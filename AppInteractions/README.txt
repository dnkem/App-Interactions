Program Description: 
    This program is has an AppMarket where a DeviceManager can add apps from the AppMarket to any of the DeviceManager's 
    devices. The devices can also be cloned and the apps within a device can be removed. The device and apps have functions like 
    remove, add, and print.

Compilation and Execution Instrcutions:
    Compiling is all done by the Makefile. To use it, type "make" into your terminal at the "a2"
    folder level. There you will get an executable. Next, type in "./a2" to test the Control.cc that I made, or
    type "./a2test" to use the given inputs to test. There you can test any of the features by entering a number, 1 through 7 for "./a2",
    and 1 through 9 for "./a2test" and exit via entering 0.
    EXTRA: To clear your .o files to late compile freshly, enter "make clean".

TO FIX:
    Check for ./a2
    - (3) it prints with icons
